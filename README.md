# Algorithms_and_Experimentation

There hasn't been any commits/pushes over the last few days as I've been getting acclimatized to my new company eGlobalTech (IT Management Consulting to Federal Agencies), where I joined on Oct 10, 2017 as a Full Stack Engineer/Senior Consultant.

I've been doing a lot of work the past of couple of days trying to understand the AWS ecosystem, DevOps model, and Atlassian Jira Service Desk.

This repo is to store code I will commit/push regularly to maintain my basic programming skills.

I will repeat a selection of algorithms at least every other day to ensure that the fundamentals I picked up in .js and .py remain strong, and also that I don't forget .js and .py syntax.

Furthermore, this repo will store all experimentation with different facets of .js (namely ES6) and .py that I am unfamiliar with, this in addition to experimentation with other languages, frameworks and DevOps technologies.
