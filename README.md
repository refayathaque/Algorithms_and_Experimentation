# Algorithms_and_Experimentation

# There hasn't been any commits/pushes the last few days as I've been getting acclimatized to my new company eGlobalTech, where I joined on Oct 10 as a Full Stack Engineer/Senior Consultant. I've been doing a lot of work trying to understand the AWS ecosystem, DevOps model, and Atlassian Jira Service Desk. This repo is intended to hold code I will commit/push regularly to maintain my basic programming skills. I will repeat basic algorithms at least every other day to ensure that the fundamentals I picked up in .js and .py remain strong, and also that the syntax stays fresh in my mind. Furthermore, this repo will allow me to experiment with facets of .js (namely ES6) and .py I am unfamiliar with, this in addition to experimenting with other languages, frameworks and DevOps technologies.
